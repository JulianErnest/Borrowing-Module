## Branching
1. When you clone the repository, make sure you are in the `main` branch. You can check by running this command:
```
git status
```
Expected output would be:
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
2. Pull the latest changes
```
git pull
```
3. Switch to the branch your module is assigned to. Example:
```
git checkout -b {branch name of your module}
// G1 example:
// Refer to the bottom for the list of all branch names
git checkout -b g1-borrowing-module
```
4. Pull the latest changes again, this time from your module

```
git pull
```
5. To push your local changes, run the following commands: 
```
git add {files you want to stage}
// or if you want to stage everything
git add . 

git commit -m [{type of change}] {meaningful message}
// Added table example:
git commit -m "[feature] added a meaningful table ðŸ˜²"  

git push
// For merge conflicts, resolve within your subgroups
